Exercise 3
Design a capture-the-flag challenge. Describe in a one-page PDF:

    the type of challenge (reversing, crackme, buffer overflow, cryptography, vulnerable web app, vulnerable server software, etc),
    technical details of the challenge,
    a write-up (how the challenge is meant to be solved),
    possible hints provided to the players, and
    any other details.

Take into consideration:

    Difficulty
    Knowledge required
    Resources necessary
        Docker container
        Network access

Implementation:

    Try your best to provide a working implementation
    Consider corner cases or possible bypasses a player could attempt
    Package your sources (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yaml, sources, etc) in a zip archive

Tips:

    Look up vulnerabilities in the CVE database
    Check https://www.exploit-db.com/
    Look at examples on https://ctf.idi.ntnu.no or https://hacker101.com
    Choose a type of challenge that is interesting to you, or that you want to learn more about

Submission (one submission per group):

    Above described PDF (indicate all group members)
    Implementation and sources, instructions for building, etc.
