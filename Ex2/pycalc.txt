Summary:
The pycalc application is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to its use of the python eval function.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch the application using nc ctf.idi.ntnu.no 5006 (you must be on the NTNU network, either by being on campus or using a vpn.)
2. Write "op <python code>" (without the quotes and brackets) to execute arbitrary python code.
    - The "op" command simply takes the input string and passes it as an argument to eval.
    - A limitation is that the code must be a one-liner. Newlines and white space are not possible to add.
      Semicolons do not work as delimiters either.

Impact:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to fully compromise the system.
